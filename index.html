He participated in the first demonstration while he was a 10th grade school student in Chattogram in 1975 against the killing of Bangabandhu and his family members. Barrister Monwar is a pioneer of the thought that education promotes peace which allows for progress. He embarked on a relentless battle to bring the student community under the banner of the Bangladesh Students Union not only in Chattogram city, but he also devoted himself to establishing a non- discriminatory society at the grass-root level. His proactive demeanor and speeches touched the hearts and minds of many. He was a popular student leader in the University of Chattogram and also he was well known to students nationally because of leadership role against the autocratic government of General Ershad.</p>
              <p className="text-base text-text_p mb-mt_16px text-justify"> After completing his masters degree from the University of Chattogram in 1985, he became more involved with the challenging responsibilities in the students and mass politics.</p>
              <p className="text-base text-text_p mb-mt_16px text-justify"> In 1987 Barrister Monwar successfully initiated and took a significant role during the Chaktai Canal Re-excavation Movement to eradicate water-logging problems of Chattogram city. He then in 1988 initiated and successfully formed the "Greater Chttaogram Development Mass Action Committee" (still this is in existence as the Brihattar Chattogram Unnoyan Sangram Committee) and led many movements including a long 48 hours general strike in 1989 all over the greater Chattaogram to implement 15 points demands for transforming Chattogram into a modern and smart city.
